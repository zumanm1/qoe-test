# Mobile Network QoE Web Application - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Product Vision
To create a unified, intelligent web platform that empowers Mobile's network engineering and operations teams to proactively monitor, analyze, and optimize network Quality of Experience (QoE) in real-time. This application will transform network management from a reactive, siloed process into a proactive, data-driven, and holistic discipline.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Diagnosing the root cause of poor network performance (e.g., slow speed tests) is a complex and time-consuming task. Data is fragmented across multiple systems and network domains (RAN, Transport, Core), making end-to-end visibility difficult. Engineers lack the tools to simulate the impact of configuration changes, leading to a trial-and-error approach to optimization. This results in extended Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and a degraded subscriber experience.

### 1.3 Proposed Solution
The Mobile Network QoE Web Application is a comprehensive platform that provides:
- Centralized, real-time monitoring across all network layers
- An interactive simulation engine to model network changes and predict QoE impact
- Automated diagnostics and optimization recommendations to guide engineers
- Rich data visualization through topological maps, dashboards, and reports

## 2. Goals and Objectives

| Goal | Objective(s) | Success Metric(s) |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Improve Operational Efficiency | Reduce the average time required to diagnose network performance issues | - Decrease Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by 40% within 6 months of launch<br>- 80% of network engineers actively using the platform monthly |
| Enhance Network Quality | Proactively identify and resolve potential network bottlenecks before they impact subscribers | - Increase the average network QoE score by 15%<br>- Reduce the number of critical performance-related alerts by 30% |
| Enable Data-Driven Decisions | Empower engineers to make informed optimization decisions based on simulations and historical data | - 90% of major network parameter changes to be simulated in the app before live deployment<br>- Increase in positive outcomes from implemented recommendations |
| Provide Executive Visibility | Offer high-level dashboards for management to track overall network health and ROI on optimizations | - Generation and review of weekly executive summary reports<br>- Correlation of network QoE improvements with subscriber churn reduction |
