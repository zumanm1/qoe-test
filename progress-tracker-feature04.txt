- **Status:** Done
- **Details:** 
    - [x] Replaced placeholder backend logic with a sophisticated QoE calculation engine.
    - [x] Modeled domain-specific impacts (Radio, Transport, Core, Packet Core).
    - [x] Calculated a weighted final QoE score and derived realistic KPIs.
    - [x] Implemented the UI for the Technical Deep Dive page, including:
        - EUTRAN Network Architecture diagram
        - GTP Tunnel Context diagram
        - LTE Interface Specifications table
        - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) table
    - [x] Resolved all routing and navigation issues by standardizing URL prefixes.

- **Next Step:** Awaiting user feedback. Future work could involve adding more detailed protocol flow diagrams or expanding the simulation capabilities.
